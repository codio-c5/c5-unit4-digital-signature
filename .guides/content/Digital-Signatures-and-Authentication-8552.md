- If encrypted with a private key, the successful decryption of a ciphertext with the corresponding public key indicates that the message was indeed encrypted with the private key that corresponds to the public key used for decrypting it.
- So if we consider the ciphertext of the message as a signature, then the successful decryption indicates a verification of the signature.
- In practice, the hash value of the message is encrypted to get the signature, not the message itself. (Recall that a message can be arbitrarily large but the hash value has a fixed length.)
