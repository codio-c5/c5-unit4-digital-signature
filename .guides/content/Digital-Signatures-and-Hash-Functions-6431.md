- Unlike paper equivalents, digital signatures are unique to each document.
- That is, the same personâ€™s digital signature on one message is different from his/her signature on a different message.
- Because a message can get arbitrarily large and public key encryption algorithms require the length of messages to be under a certain maximum, instead of the message itself being signed, the hash of the message is signed. (Recall that a message can be arbitrarily large but the hash value has a fixed length.)
