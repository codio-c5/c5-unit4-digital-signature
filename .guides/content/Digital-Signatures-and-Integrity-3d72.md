- Alice’s signature on a message does not verify, one of two things might have happened:

	1: It wasn’t Alice’s private key that was used to sign the message

	OR

	2: The message was altered, so the hash of the message does not match the signature.
	
- If Alice signed the message, then the digital signature detects the alteration in the message; hence the signature indicates the integrity of the message.
