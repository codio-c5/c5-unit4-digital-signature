- A trusted entity that issues electronic documents and digital certificates that verify a digital entityâ€™s identity on the Internet.
- Signs these certificates using its private key; its public key is made available to all interested parties in a self-signed CA certificate.
- CAs use the trusted root certificate to create a "chain of trust."
- Many root certificates are embedded in web browsers so they have built-in trust of those CAs.
- Web servers, email clients, smartphones, and many other types of hardware and software also support PKI and contain trusted root certificates from the major CAs.
